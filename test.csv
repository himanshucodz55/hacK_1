X_tYrnv_o6A,"These are the molecular machines inside your body that make cell division possible. Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno"

zFYFHQq6dgs,"Get your life together with the Nifty Organization Journal: bit.ly/2AYkXm2\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\n5 Ways To Use The Last Bit Of Everything\n \nDIY Tinted Lip Balm\n\nMATERIALS\nShea butter\nCocoa butter\nLipstick\nLip balm container\nBeauty Spatula\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nWith the help of a beauty spatula, remove excess lipstick from the inside of a lipstick tube. \nUsing a double boiler, melt the lipstick and add two parts shea butter and one part cocoa butter. We used 2 teaspoons of shea butter and 1 teaspoon of cocoa butter. Mix. \nTip: Use less shea butter and cocoa butter for a more pigmented lip balm, and more shea butter and cocoa butter for a more subtle tinted lip balm. \nPour the mixture into a container and let it sit to cool. \nUse like a regular lip balm. \n\n\nCandle Melts\n\nMATERIALS\nTweezers\nAlmost empty candle jars\nSilicone mold\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nPlace your candle jar into a pot filled with hot water (with the water line not passing the middle of the jar) and allow the wax to melt completely. \nRemove any wicks with a pair of tweezers. \nCarefully remove the candle jar from the hot water and pour the melted wax into the silicone mold. \nLet the candle wax harden completely. \nEnjoy by using in a candle warmer. \n\n\nMustard Salad Dressing\n\nMATERIALS\nAlmost empty mustard bottle\nHoney\nOlive oil\nApple cider vinegar\nSalt \nPepper\n\n \nINSTRUCTIONS \nIf you’re having trouble getting use out of the mustard at the bottom of the bottle, this is perfect for you! Open the top of the bottle and pour in the ingredients necessary to make a delicious salad dressing. We went for a basic mustard vinaigrette using honey (to taste), 3 parts olive oil, one part apple cider vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. \nOptional: Add other herbs for extra flavor. \nSeal the bottle back up and shake it to mix the ingredients. The bottle itself will act as a perfect container to pour out the dressing. Store in the refrigerator for up to 4 months. \n\n\nScented Epsom Salt\n\nMATERIALS\nEpsom salt\nEmpty essential oil bottle\nTweezers\nContainer (that fits the epsom salt) \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nPour epsom salt into a resealable container. \nOpen up the bottle of essential oil and separate its parts as necessary. \nPlace the pieces of the essential oil bottle inside the epsom salt, with the salt completely covering the parts of the bottle. Close the container and give it a shake. \nLeave for 24 hours. \nAll of the essential oil residue that was left inside the empty bottle will have been absorbed by the epsom salt, leaving behind a deliciously scented epsom salt. \n\n\nNail Polish Marbling\n\nMATERIALS\nPlastic container\nNail polish\nPointed stirring stick or wooden skewer\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nFill your plastic container approximately halfway with warm water. \nSwirl nail polish over it, use your stick to create a design. Work quickly to ensure that the nail polish doesn’t get too tacky (this makes marbling more difficult). \nSlowly press the object that you would like to marble into the nail polish, and carefully flip it out to keep the nail polish from sliding off of the surface. Let it dry completely before using, and enjoy! \nOptional: Apply a sealant over the nail polish to make the design permanent. \n\n\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/47724\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network"

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from our online shop! - https://shop.simonscat.com/"

A0FZIwabctw,"When Falcon Heavy lifted off, it became the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two.  With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost.\n\nFollowing liftoff, the two side boosters separated from the center core and returned to landing site for future reuse.  \n\nFalcon Heavy put a Tesla Roadster and its passenger, Starman, into orbit around the sun. At max velocity Starman and the Roadster will travel 11 km/s (7mi/s) and travel 400 million km (250 million mi) from Earth."

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from our online shop! - https://shop.simonscat.com/"

People want movies that feature people of color and their stories. But there is a dearth in the supply of films produced that do that. Vox spoke with the UCLA sociology professor Darnell Hunt about how Hollywood has progressed to diversify its characters and stories to reflect the demographics of the US. Watch this video to understand how America’s changing makeup is key to Black Panther’s early dominance at the box office.\n\nFor a closer look at the data, you can visit these links:\nhttp://bunchecenter.ucla.edu/2017/02/21/new-2017-hollywood-diversity-report/\n\nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217\n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Never cracked or dropped my phone in water since i owned a cell phone)\n-3 weeks later phone completely drains *slept with a few percent left in battery.\n-plugged charger to phone. \n-phone wont charge\n-called samsung , transferred to tech support, trouble shoot, then repair ticket started (3-4 week wait according to rep)\n-needing a phone was an issue so i called sprint to see if they could help me with my problem. Tech support, troubleshoot, cant help me because i didnt buy insurance, said i still would have to pay $75 for a replacement even with insurance(even if they sold me a lemon phone that was less than a month old) told me to go to a sprint store to see if they could help.\n-went to sprint store , waited 45 min , repair tech troubleshoot phone ,phone still not responding. \n-tech checks my account status to see what they could do, said i didnt have insurance so they couldnt do an exchange. Mentioned again i would have to pay $75 even if i had insurance and i still would have to wait for a replacement to come in which is most likely a refurbished device.\n- screw it so i sent it to samsung.\n- 3 weeks later got a refurbished phone with light scratches.\n-phone battery drains faster than usual,  apps freezing and crashing. \n-outcome of the situation... i paid full price for a used phone.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n@ 2:32 you can see the flash/line i was referring to.\n\n**UPDATE 12/24/2017\nI finally got the phone back. looks like I got back a refurbished phone. link below is to my other video / unboxing of the note 8.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6z0Nt0VyseM\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nCompletely drained my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Battery. Woke up in the morning and tried to charge it. Phone would not communicate with the charger. This is how sprint treated me after selling me a lemon defective phone."

3D_ZODCSKXo,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday, January 17th, 2018) Mark Ellis, Jay Washington, Jon Schnepp, Kristian Harloff discuss the following:\n\n1) Flash’ Standalone Film Taps Directors John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein\n\n2) First Official Synopsis for ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ Teases an Eventful Adventure\n\n3) First Trailer for Gus Van Sant’s: ‘Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot’ starring Joaquin Phoenix, Jack Black and Jonah Hill\n\n4) New ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp’ Image Shows Off the Title Team, All Suited Up\n\n5) New trailer released for Love, Simon\n\n6) Mail Bag \n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nVariety is reporting that the Vacation helmers John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein are in negotiations to direct Flashpoint, the Flash’s standalone feature starring Ezra Miller. Interestingly enough, the studio initially asked Ben Affleck to return to the director’s chair, but he eventually passed. This comes as Warner Bros. begins reshuffling its D.C. properties, with New Line exec Walter Hamada recently promoted to oversee its comic book movies. \n\nDisney has released the first official synopsis for Solo: A Star Wars Story, the major new Star Wars movie that’s coming out in a little over four months. As part of Disney’s 2018 preview kit, the synopsis seems to tease the release of the first trailer, which should be coming any day now.\n\nAGREE OR DISAGREE\n\nAmazon Studios has released the first trailer for Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot. Written and directed by Gus Van Sant, the film is based on the memoir of the same name by cartoonist, artist, and musician John Callahan. Joaquin Phoenix plays Callahan, who becomes a quadriplegic in a car accident at the age of 21 after a day of drinking. \n\nYesterday, Disney released its 2018 preview kit teasing their upcoming slate of films and inside featured the first official look at Hope Van Dyne alongside Scott Lang in Marvel’s upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly reprise their roles in the movie alongside Michael Peña and Michael Douglas, that will also introduce Hope’s mother, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. \n\n20th Century Fox has released a new trailer for Love, Simon. Based on Becky Albertalli’s novel, Greg Berlanti’s film follows seventeen-year-old Simon Spier (Nick Robinson), who is currently grappling with how to tell his family and friends that he’s gay while also working to identify an anonymous classmate he’s fallen for online. The film is set for release on March 16th. \n\nMAIL BAG \n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Jay: https://twitter.com/MrJayWashington\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

NuXHriwQB9g,"This is a test fire in advance of SpaceX's upcoming Falcon Heavy test launch. The test occurred on 1/24/2018 at Kennedy Space Center's LC-39 Pad A which is the same pad that many Apollo and Space Shuttle launches took place from. SpaceX is currently leasing the pad from NASA. Birds can been seen scattering near the area and the delayed rumble of the 12 second test can also be heard. No date has yet been announced for the test launch. This launch will be the first time SpaceX has launched a vehicle of this configuration and at 140,700 lb to low Earth orbit, it will represent the largest lift capacity of any currently available rocket. Although still short of the 150,000 to 290,000 lb capacity of NASA's upcoming SLS rocket (and well shy of Saturn V's 310,000 lb capacity), this rocket will more than double what is currently available from the Delta IV Heavy."

OvHskUT3XTI,"This video lets you see a different aspect of a doctor's life. For the past 5 weeks, I've been working in the ICU, facing so much death and so many grieving families... at times it has been incredibly difficult. There often isn't time to process your emotions during the day while you are working and these experiences can build up.\n\nThe question becomes: how do you process these experiences in a healthy way? I believe this happens on many levels. \nFirst is at the level of the team, with debriefing and discussions. In the ICU we actually do some formal sessions after challenging codes (when a patient's heart stops or they stop breathing) with all the doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and students. \nThen it's important to figure out what works best for you - do you process thoughts through journaling? exercising? blogging? \nPersonally I find talking to trusted friends, family and colleagues is the best way for me to process my thoughts and emotions.\n\nI want this video to remind you to TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF and to LOOK OUT FOR OTHERS who may be struggling! We all experience highs and lows in life. \n\nThank you so much for watching! I know this was a heavy topic and different than my usual vlogs in hospital. I believe it's a crucial topic and I hope you enjoyed it!\n\nCOMMENT BELOW - I am really looking forward to having a conversation with you guys and hearing your thoughts!\n\nSUBSCRIBE to experience more of my journey as a junior doctor! \n\n~ Siobhan (aka Violin MD) ~\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n♫ Background Music ♫ \n\nRhodesia by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nArtist: http://www.twinmusicom.org/\n\nBrahms Symphony No. 3 - Scherzo"

The tiny, 1oz patties smashed thin on a griddle, smothered with onions, and placed between steamed buns are a regional speciality that have been perfected at the Jersey City landmark, White Mana. The history alone is worth the trip, which is why host Alvin Cailan invited Top Chef judge/host and fellow burger burger fanatic, Padma Lakshmi, to soak up some Jersey lore. Get to know the diner's ties to 1939 World's Fair, as well as its surprising connection to heavyweight champ Mike Tyson, from longtime owner Mario Costa.

Learn more at http://omele.to/2jrQVQo.\n\nFilmmaker and actor Tyler Lionel Parr offers an affecting dual portrait of two men -- one in normal circumstances and one homeless -- on a journey of self-awareness.\n\nThe first half of the film focuses on Donald, as he deals with a very bad morning. The second half follows Charlie, a homeless drug addict who is trying to get through his day alive.\n\nThe two men could not seem more different on the surface, but the film's tone of gentle humor and patient compassion is a perfect lens to view the breadth and depth of humanity.\n\nIronied is defined by its unusual two-act structure, beautiful photography and stellar performance. Both characters are portrayed by the director, but the acting is so natural, engaging and seamless than many viewers may not realize the same man portrays two different characters.\n\nSincere, genuine and made with great heart, Ironied has a beautiful message -- all of us are just trying to get through our days with some degree of grace and dignity.\n\n► https://www.tylerparr.com\n\nSong: Iron Pump by Olenka and the Autumn Lovers\n► http://olenkalovers.com/music_oatal.html\n► https://olenkalovers.bandcamp.com/track/iron-pump\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nConnect with Omeleto!\n\nFacebook ► http://facebook.com/omeletocom/\nTwitter ► http://twitter.com/omeletocom\nInstagram ► http://instagram.com/omeletocom/\nSnapchat ► http://snapchat.com/add/omeletocom\nNewsletter ► http://omeleto.com/join/\n\n🎬 Got a film?

Nobody has time for that and they’re like a buck or two\nTake a 13.5oz/398ml can of pure pumpkin. Not “pumpkin pie filling.” Don’t be an animal\nBut that in a bowl. It’s gonna be thick. Be prepared for that\nAdd two eggs\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \nReduce it to 350. \nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow."

r4qSDOHeWjk,"In the world of burgers, the In-N-Out vs. Shake Shack rivalry is the stuff of legend, pitting east coast against west coast in a battle of patty supremacy. But rather than feed the fire of an old flame, Alvin Cailan is teaming up with YouTube legend Andrew Rea (Binging With Babish) to teach people how to make both of these iconic burgers at home. Better yet, they've devised the ultimate peace treaty: a Double Shack x Double-Double Animal-style Voltron burger. It's a moment in burger history you won't want to miss.  \n\nFirst We Feast's The Burger Show is a new web series that explores everything about modern burger culture—from the rise of Instagram-bait stunt burgers, to the enduring influence of regional styles—through the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan. Alvin's breakfast-sandwich empire in Los Angeles put him on the culinary map, but it's burgers that are his true passion. Now he's in NYC to understand what drives his obsession, and he's linking up with folks like Adam Richman, Matty Matheson, and Binging With Babish's Andrew Rea to help him along the way.\n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect."

The perfect foundationt trick is really in the foundation contouring...it's what makes the skin look perfect, slenderizes your face, brings out your features and makes you look alive and glowy!\nSo here is the foundation I've been obsessed with because it makes my skin look perfect! It is full coverage and gives your skin the perfect dewy glow that you can then set with powder.\n\nAll you need is 2-3 foundation shades...\nYour first shade should be the lightest foundation that matched the skin at your jawline.\nThe second foundation shade should be 2 to even 4 shades darker than the light shade.\nAnd if you use a third shade like me, it can be a color right in between the darkest foundation and the lightest.\nApply foundation in a dabbing motion to get the most coverage. I like a VERY FULL COVERAGE FOUNDATION, myself! I want my foundation to look like I have perfect doll skin!\nI am going to show you how to apply foundation, the way that I put my foundation on every day.

With a fresh sound that mixes old-school soul vocals and R&B beats, the Colombian singer caught the attention of hip-hop artists such as Snoop Dogg and Tyler, The Creator. Uchis has since built a resume of additional collaborations with Tyler, Miguel, and Latin music superstar Juanes. She also grabbed her first Grammy nomination this year for Best R&B Performance, as a feature on Daniel Caesar’s track “Get You.”\n\nUchis' latest hit is the retro-sounding and smooth single “After The Storm,” featuring Tyler and funk legend Bootsy Collins. Racking in over 6 million streams on YouTube, the song tackles themes of survival and inner conflict. Uchis also references her own personal difficulties of living U.S., far away from her Colombian family members.\n\nRead more on Genius: https://genius.com/a/kali-uchis-breaks-down-official-lyrics-for-after-the-storm-on-genius-video-series-verified\n\nRead all the lyrics to After The Storm on Genius: https://genius.com/Kali-uchis-after-the-storm-lyrics\n\nSubscribe to Genius: http://bit.ly/2cNV6nz\nGenius on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Genius\nGenius on Instagram: http://instagram.com/genius\nGenius on Facebook: https://facebook.com/Geniusdotcom\nhttp://genius.com"

Through case studies and on-site lessons with Annie during a magazine shoot, you’ll learn her photography techniques and be inspired to try new ways of approaching your craft.\n\nIn a career that spans four decades, Annie Leibovitz has created iconic photographs of the world’s greatest leaders and artists. From her intimate portraits of John Lennon to her dynamic images of Serena Williams, Annie’s work has graced the covers of hundreds of magazines, including Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone, and Vogue.\n\nIn 1972, Annie became the first woman to be named chief photographer at Rolling Stone. Since then, her work has been exhibited in the Smithsonian Institute, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Some of Annie’s most indelible images include John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s famous “kiss” portrait, Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the U.S.A. album cover, and Demi Moore’s often-imitated pregnancy portrait on the cover of Vanity Fair.\n\nFor photographers and artists, Annie Leibovitz’s MasterClass is the best way to learn how to transcend technology and create timeless pieces of art, no matter what gear you have.

Raised by her aristocratic great-uncle Lord Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson) and his wife (Emily Watson), Belle's lineage affords her certain privileges, yet her status prevents her from the traditions of noble social standing.  While her cousin Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon) chases suitors for marriage, Belle is left on the sidelines wondering if she will ever find love.  After meeting an idealistic young vicar's son bent on changing society, he and Belle help shape Lord Mansfield's role as Lord Chief Justice to end slavery in England."

JrFiNSueT3Y,"More Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nFirst and foremost, our hats go off to Mr. Morgan Freeman also known as the man I hope to narrate my life story one day. He was honored tonight with the Lifetime Achievement Award. \nMorgan’s good friend, Rita Moreno presented him with the prestigious award and the display of their friendship was beyond adorable. Morgan was sure to thank her along with his family and friends who flew out to celebrate with him as well as his peers in the room. Then Morgan took a moment to point out the fact that the SAG award statue, known as the Actor has a bit of a bias to it. \nYou gotta love Morgan Freeman. Another person you can’t help but to love is Sterling K. Brown. He won best male actor in a drama series for his role on This Is Us making history once again becoming the first black man to win in that category. \nSterling also thanked his peers in the room and his beautiful wife who had the sweetest most adorable reaction to his winning streak continuing.  \nWhen the camera panned to Ryan’s face while Sterling was giving his speech, she was literally shaking with pride and happiness. \nWhich brings me to yet another moving moment during the show. Nicole Kidman won her first SAG award tonight for best Female Actor in a television Movie or Limited Series for her work  in Big Little Lies. She got choked up noting that winning means so much to her because she has been acting since she was 14 years old. \nShe went on to thank her co-stars, fellow nominees and female actors who have inspired her and paved the way for her career. \nShe continued saying - We've proven — and these actresses and so many more have proven — we are potent and powerful and viable. I just beg that the industry stays behind us because our stories are finally being told. It's only the beginning.\n\n\nFor More Clevver Visit:\nThere are 2 types of people: those who follow us on Facebook and those who are missing out http://facebook.com/clevver\n\nKeep up with us on Instagram: http://instagr.am/Clevver\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ClevverTV\nWebsite: http://www.clevver.com \n\n\nAdd us to your circles on Google+: http://google.com/+ClevverNews\nTweet Me: http://www.twitter.com/Drew__dorsey"

RVpcL0nL7iE,My soft-flowing hair should be the Eighth Wonder of the World. It's that glorious. Men covet it. Women fawn over it.\n\nSo that's how confident I felt about dismissing the New Orleans Saints after the team's 0-2 start in 2017. I put my hair on the line during an episode of Dunc & Holder on Sports 1280 AM and NOLA.com after the Saints fell in Week 2. The video proof is below:\n\n\nThe Saints proceeded to win eight consecutive games after my grand proclamation. They finished the regular season 11-5 and as the NFC South champions.\n\nI'll take all the credit for being the team's motivating factor. I'll also have to pay the price and shave my head.\n\nI'll have my hair completely shredded at Tracey's Original Irish Bar (2604 Magazine Street) 4 p.m.-6 p.m. Thursday afternoon.\n\nColumnist Jeff Duncan will certainly have the first chop at my hair for being the person to claim a 10-win season for the Saints. Many others will fight for the chance to finish the job.

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot. As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy. Originally conceived as a concept album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the show eventually made its way to the stage in 1971 and garnered five Tony nominations in addition to winning a Drama Desk Award for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Now this globally celebrated classic comes to NBC in 2018 for a one-of-a-kind live staging on Easter Sunday that's sure to amaze with jaw-dropping spectacle, an all-star cast of beloved recording artists and a fresh soundtrack featuring such hits as Heaven on Their Minds, I Don't Know How to Love Him and Superstar.\n\nSuperstar: Brandon Victor Dixon - Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\nhttps://youtu.be/yleuZbY8rKk\n\nNBC on YouTube\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc"

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from our online shop! - https://shop.simonscat.com/"

American speed skater Shani Davis boycotted the event because he was upset he was not chosen to carry the flag. In a tweet, Davis called a lost coin toss to carry the flag “dishonorable.” The 4-time Olympian lost the coin toss for the honor to luger Erin Hamlin.

Ya_trIAWIXA,"Wow! Thank you so much for supporting the Real Doctor Reacts to series. I said that if you get the grey's anatomy video to 15k likes I'll do another episode and you CRUSHED it by getting it 200k+ likes. I dove into the comments section to see what medical tv drama you wanted me to review next and it seemed like the good doctor was the obvious choice. Get ready TV Doctors, because Dr. Mike is coming for you =] \n\nFull disclosure, I have never watched an episode of the good doctor on ABC so I decided to go ahead and start my tv medical drama review off with the first episode ( good doctor 1x01 ) of the series. I was really curious myself to see if the good doctor is a medically accurate show.\n\nI really did enjoy this medical tv show because I think it did a lot of things well. It gave an interesting look into what life is like a for a surgeon and a resident. Being a surgical resident is not an easy job and to make the situation even more complex Dr. Sean Murphy has autism so they did a great job of breaking down these circumstances.\n\nI hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Good Doctor / Real Doctor Reacts to the Good Doctor. If you want me to continue making this series please like the video and leave me a comment on which show or episode you'd like for me to review next.

The driver left the scene of the accident after a few Minutes and left the busted truck sitting there in the middle of a busy city road without hazard lights on or any attempt at securing the accident. Later, the Police had to extract the truck from under the bridge. Not sure what the deal was with that."

kjC1zmZo30U,"http://www.tagthemovie.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tagthemovie\nhttps://www.twitter.com/tagthemovie\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tagthemovie\n\nFor one month every year, five highly competitive friends hit the ground running in a no-holds-barred game of tag they’ve been playing since the first grade—risking their necks, their jobs and their relationships to take each other down with the battle cry: “You’re It!”   \n\nThis year, the game coincides with the wedding of their only undefeated player, which should finally make him an easy target.  But he knows they’re coming…and he’s ready.  \n\nBased on a true story, the New Line Cinema comedy “Tag” shows how far some guys will go to be the last man standing.\n\n“Tag” is directed by Jeff Tomsic (Comedy Central’s “Broad City”), with a starring ensemble cast led by Ed Helms (The “Hangover” movies, “We’re the Millers”), Jake Johnson (TV’s “New Girl”), Annabelle Wallis (“The Mummy”), Rashida Jones (TV’s “Parks and Recreation”), Isla Fisher (“Now You See Me”), Leslie Bibb (“Iron Man 2”), Hannibal Buress (“Neighbors”), with Jon Hamm (“Baby Driver,” TV’s “Mad Men”) and Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner (“The Hurt Locker,” “The Town”).  \nThe “Tag” screenplay was written by Rob McKittrick (“Waiting”) and Mark Steilen (TV’s “Mozart in the Jungle”), screen story by Mark Steilen, and based on the Wall Street Journal article entitled “It Takes Planning, Caution to Avoid Being It,” by Russell Adams.  The film is produced by Todd Garner and Mark Steilen, with Hans Ritter, Richard Brener, Walter Hamada and Dave Neustadter serving as executive producers.\n\nThe creative filmmaking team includes director of photography Larry Blanford, production designer David Sandefur, editor Josh Crockett, and costume designer Denise Wingate.  \n\n“Tag” is set for a June 15, 2018, release.  \n\nA New Line Cinema presentation of a Broken Road Production, “Tag” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.  www.tagthemovie.com"
IC_lnyn2R2Q,"From Clint Eastwood comes The 15:17 to Paris - in theaters February 9.\n\nhttp://www.1517toparis.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/1517toparis\nhttps://twitter.com/1517toParis\nhttps://www.instagram.com/1517toparis\n\n--\n\nFrom Clint Eastwood comes “The 15:17 to Paris,” which tells the real-life story of three men whose brave act turned them into heroes during a highspeed railway ride.\n\nIn the early evening of August 21, 2015, the world watched in stunned silence as the media reported a thwarted terrorist attack on Thalys train #9364 bound for Paris—an attempt prevented by three courageous young Americans traveling through Europe.  The film follows the course of the friends’ lives, from the struggles of childhood through finding their footing in life, to the series of unlikely events leading up to the attack.  Throughout the harrowing ordeal, their friendship never wavers, making it their greatest weapon and allowing them to save the lives of the more than 500 passengers on board.\n\nThe heroic trio is comprised of Anthony Sadler, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who play themselves in the film.  Starring alongside them are Jenna Fischer (“Hall Pass,” TV’s “The Office”); Judy Greer (“War for the Planet of the Apes”); Ray Corasani (TV’s upcoming “The Long Road Home”); PJ Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”); Tony Hale (TV’s “Veep”); and Thomas Lennon (“Transformers: Age of Extinction”).  Paul-Mikél Williams plays the younger Anthony, Bryce Gheisar plays the younger Alek, and William Jennings plays the younger Spencer.\n\nEastwood (“Sully,” “American Sniper”) directs from a screenplay by Dorothy Blyskal, based on the book by Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, Spencer Stone and Jeffrey E. Stern.  Eastwood also produces the film, along with Tim Moore, Kristina Rivera and Jessica Meier.  The film’s executive producer is Bruce Berman.\n\nBehind the scenes, the creative team includes frequent collaborators Tom Stern, who served as cinematographer on 13 of Eastwood’s previous films, and Deborah Hopper, who has served as Eastwood’s costume designer on 17 prior films; editor Blu Murray, who most recently cut “Sully,” and that film’s composer, Christian Jacob.  Veteran art director Kevin Ishioka, whose work can be seen in “Sully” and in “Dunkirk,” serves as production designer.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Malpaso production, “The 15:17 to Paris.”  The film will be released in theaters on February 9, 2018.  It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures."

d99_h30swtM,"I'd never heard of moiré effect beacons until I got an email asking me about them. It seemed like a really clever idea - but it was really hard to research. Or at least it was, until I stumbled upon one magic phrase that revealed its history.\n\nIt turns out this thing's called an Inogon leading mark or Inogon light -- Inogon, not Inogen -- and it's a Swedish invention from the 1980s. But there's still a question: why is being used to mark an undersea cable, instead of guiding people home?\n\n(Full disclosure: there were some weird strobing effects from the light that only showed up when I got the footage into the edit, so the image you see here has been digitally stabilised so it appears the same way on screen as it does in person!)\n\nThanks to Andrew Stine for suggesting this!\n\nReferences:\nThe original Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern\nThe patent: https://patents.google.com/patent/US4629325\nThe US military analysis [PDF]: http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a168108.pdf\n\nI'm at http://tomscott.com\non Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo"

It's downright dumb.\nIt looks like the end of the line for me here and frankly I'm terribly glum\nThat the promising future where I get to train with Luke Skywalker won't ever come\nAnd these shackles I'm shackled in sure seem robust so I'm stuck here on my bum\nIn a base this huge I feel so tiny\nOh and why's that tall Stormtrooper shiny?\nIf I could just find a way into this tin man's head, I\nMight survive to become the second-to-last Jedi\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: What did you say?)\n\nHe responded. That's a start.\nThere's a glimmer of hope in this possibly-orphaned Jakkuvian scavenger's heart\nI can do this, I swear it, by each little line that I drew like a loneliness chart\nI can do this, I swear it, by each little meal that would always taste just like a fart\nBy the bloke I like more than I care to\nBy my sensible three-level hairdo\nI call on the Force and if somehow this works, I said I\nMight survive to become the second-to-last Jedi\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum.)\n\nI'm done for! Blast it!\nThought I had him for a sec\nBut it turns out I'm screwed which has ruined my mood and now I'm a nervous wreck\nFocus! Get past it!\nDo the trick you did back when\nWithout even trying, you found yourself spying on the mind of Kylo Ren\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: I will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.)\nWhaaaat?\n(He unlocks the restraints.)\n\nTa-da! See ya, big guy!\nI cannot believe that it worked, but it worked, and I honestly do not know why\nIf I hurry away before they even know I've fled I\nwill be well on my way or at least one step closer to having a chance to become \nthe second-to-last Jediiiiii!\nAnd you'll drop your weapon. \n(he does)\nYes!\n\n** THANKS FOR WATCHING! :) **\n\nIf you made it all the way to here, comment I hope Daisy Ridley sees this below!"

But there's still a question: why is being used to mark an undersea cable, instead of guiding people home?\n\n(Full disclosure: there were some weird strobing effects from the light that only showed up when I got the footage into the edit, so the image you see here has been digitally stabilised so it appears the same way on screen as it does in person!)\n\nThanks to Andrew Stine for suggesting this!\n\nReferences:\nThe original Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern\nThe patent: https://patents.google.com/patent/US4629325\nThe US military analysis [PDF]: http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a168108.pdf\n\nI'm at http://tomscott.com\non Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo"

While her cousin Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon) chases suitors for marriage, Belle is left on the sidelines wondering if she will ever find love.  After meeting an idealistic young vicar's son bent on changing society, he and Belle help shape Lord Mansfield's role as Lord Chief Justice to end slavery in England."

07Um1PY_P4o,"In Theaters January 12, 2018\n\n Following the worldwide hit “Paddington,” one of the most successful family films of all time, this much-anticipated sequel finds Paddington (Ben Whishaw) happily settled with the Brown family in London, where he has become a popular member of the local community, spreading joy and marmalade wherever he goes.  \n\n While searching for the perfect present for his beloved Aunt Lucy’s hundredth birthday, Paddington sees a unique pop-up book in Mr. Gruber’s antique shop, and embarks upon a series of odd jobs to buy it.  But when the book is stolen, it’s up to Paddington and the Browns to unmask the thief.\n \n Reuniting many of the original film’s cast while welcoming those in new roles, “Paddington 2” stars Golden Globe nominee Hugh Bonneville (“Downton Abbey”), Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins (“Blue Jasmine”), three-time Golden Globe nominee Brendan Gleeson (“The Guard,” “Into the Storm,” “In Bruges”), Oscar nominee Julie Walters (“Billy Elliot,” “Educating Rita”), Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (“Iris”), and Oscar winner Peter Capaldi (short, “Franz Kafka’s It’s a Wonderful Life”), with Golden Globe and BAFTA Award winner Hugh Grant (“Four Weddings and a Funeral”), and BAFTA winner Ben Whishaw (“The Hollow Crown”) as the voice of Paddington.  The starring ensemble also includes Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, and Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (“Vera Drake”) as the voice of Aunt Lucy. \n\n Paddington’s return to the big screen was again helmed by BAFTA-nominated director Paul King (“Paddington,” “Come Fly with Me,” “The Mighty Boosh”) from a script written by King and Simon Farnaby (Sky TV’s “Yonderland,” “Mindhorn”), based on the best-selling and internationally adored books by Michael Bond, creator of Paddington Bear.  \n\n The film was produced by multiple award-winning producer David Heyman (the “Harry Potter” films, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” Oscar nominee for “Gravity”).   Serving as executive producers were Rosie Alison, Jeffrey Clifford, Alexandra Ferguson Derbyshire, Ron Halpern, and Didier Lupfer.  \n\n Creative talent returning behind the camera included director of photography Erik Alexander Wilson (“Tyrannosaur,” “Submarine”), production designer Gary Williamson (“Bunny and the Bull,” “Submarine”), Oscar-winning costume designer Lindy Hemming (“Wonder Woman,” “The Dark Knight”), and editor Mark Everson (“Mindhorn,” “Alan Partridge”), joined by editor Jonathan Amos (“Baby Driver”).  Visual effects were provided by the highly acclaimed British VFX company, Framestore, led by animation director Pablo Grillo (“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them”) and VFX supervisors Andy Kind (“Gravity”) and Glen Pratt (“Beauty and the Beast”).  The score is composed by Academy Award winner Dario Marianelli (“Atonement”).  \n\n “Paddington 2” was shot on location in and around central London, as well as on the legendary soundstages of Warner Bros. Leavesden and Pinewood film studios.\n\n Warner Bros. Pictures and STUDIOCANAL present, in association with Anton Capital Entertainment S.C.A., a Heyday Films Production, “Paddington 2.”  The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.  www.paddington.com\n\n “Paddington 2” is rated PG for some action and mild rude humor.\n\n©2017 StudioCanal S.A.S.

5_O5bT3hfkQ,"Caviar is one of the most expensive foods in the world. Selling for up to $35,000 per kilo, it's revered and relished by aristocrats across the globe. But it's an acquired taste. Turns out, caviar wasn't always so valuable. In the 19th century, sturgeon species in the US were so common that there are accounts of caviar being offered in saloons for free, like bar nuts. In Europe, fishermen were feeding the eggs to their pigs, or leaving it on the beach to spoil. What changed?\n\nSimilar to true champagne, caviar doesn't come from just anywhere. This, for example, is not caviar. To get the real thing, it has to be eggs from a sturgeon. There are 27 species around the world in North America, Europe, and Asia. But probably not for long. \n\nArne Ludwig: In this case, sturgeon will die out because humans are over-harvesting their populations and destroying their habitats.\n\nIn 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed 18 species on its Red List of Threatened Species, making the sturgeon the most endangered group of species on Earth. But lists like these are bittersweet. On the one hand, they can help protect the sturgeon from further population decline. On the other hand, the rarer that caviar becomes, the more we can't get enough of it. There's actually an economic idea that explains this. It's called the rarity value thesis and it describes how rarity increases the value of the item. Sturgeon can weigh up to several thousand pounds, and produce hundreds of pounds of roe at a time. The world record belongs to a beluga sturgeon that weighed 2,520 pounds and yielded 900 pounds of roe. Today, she'd be worth about half a million dollars. \n\nIt wasn't until around the 20th century when these freshwater fish and their eggs became a rare commodity. Pollution poisoned their waters and dams blocked their spawning grounds upstream. They had nowhere to reproduce and continued to be overfished for their meat and roe. On top of that, it takes 8-20 years for a female to sexually mature, depending on the species. She can produce millions of eggs at a time, but odds are that only one will survive to adulthood. In the end, the sturgeon population couldn't keep up with demand and their coveted eggs became the jewels of the luxury food scene. Today, caviar imports and exports are closely regulated in the US., which is partly why it's so expensive. \n\nDeborah Keane: People forget that every single egg, every one of these eggs is taken off by hand. Now, remember that we're dealing with a raw seafood endangered species. So it is basically like eating and dealing with edible elephant tusks. It is that heavily regulated.\n\nThat's why today, the majority of caviar comes from sturgeon farms.\n\nDeborah Keane: Little did I know that by 2011, all wild caviar would become illegal on the planet. When I started there were six farms in the world and only two producing caviar in the world and that was in 2004. Now, there are 2,000 farms.\n\nOne farm, in particular, in China called Kaluga Queen produces 35% of the world's caviar. Caviar there is harvested with the classic Russian and Iranian technique, which involves killing the fish and then extracting the eggs. Other farms are exploring a different technique, which doesn't involve killing the fish. It's called stripping. The fish are injected with a hormone that triggers their urge to release eggs. Farmers have been doing this for many years, but not to get caviar — just to produce more fish. It wasn't until recently that people started canning this stuff and selling it as caviar.\n\nDmitrijs Tracuks: The biggest thing is that yes, fish stays alive. You have really small impact on the fish because you do it really fast. You take the fish out of the water, you put it on the special holding facility. The fish has already started to spawn and so all that requires is to press on the belly, massage the belly and the caviar will just flow out of the fish.\n\nThe idea behind no-kill caviar is a commendable one, but it has yet to catch on. Either way, with caviar farms in place, this gives the wild sturgeon population a chance to recover. But whether or not, that happens is largely up to us.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Why isn’t ‘Off to the Vet’ available in full on YouTube? A. ‘Off to the Vet’ film production and crowdfunding campaign was a huge undertaking for the Simon’s Cat Team. Our hope is to produce more long form, full colour content for our fans but without having to turn to them through crowdfunding again. The film was completed in 2015 and submitted it to a selection of international film festivals over the following months. During this time, it was exclusively available to all funders that contributed via our private production blog. The feedback we have received from our funders has been overwhelming positive and we hope they are extremely proud of making the film a possibility. If you are a funder and have any questions regarding the campaign, please contact us at igg@simonscat.com\n\nQ. What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Even though the films are made on computer software, they are still hand-animated in a traditional manner, frame to frame. It usually takes between 12 and 25 drawings to create 1 second of a Simon's Cat film.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official web shop: \nhttp://www.shop.simonscat.com"

Hmb0Q0Q_7jo,"After 3 months of work and probably more than 500 fails, I'm happy to present you my best video ever. \nSince magnets and marbles I've always wanted to make a big chain reaction in one take with this 2D style ! \n\nIt's also a one marble path which means you have to follow the same marble for all the tricks (in that case the little blue one.) Because everything is in a tilted plane, the hard part was to find different ways of having the marble riding up along the table (magnets, falling weight, catapult ...). To do that, the marble has to be light. And because everything has to be triggered by this little marble, all the tricks are very unstable. Most fails happened when an element fall down earlier than expected.\n\nI learned a lot about chain reaction, and I discovered the amazing power of the hot glue gun !"

The second half follows Charlie, a homeless drug addict who is trying to get through his day alive.\n\nThe two men could not seem more different on the surface, but the film's tone of gentle humor and patient compassion is a perfect lens to view the breadth and depth of humanity.\n\nIronied is defined by its unusual two-act structure, beautiful photography and stellar performance. Both characters are portrayed by the director, but the acting is so natural, engaging and seamless than many viewers may not realize the same man portrays two different characters.\n\nSincere, genuine and made with great heart, Ironied has a beautiful message -- all of us are just trying to get through our days with some degree of grace and dignity.\n\n► https://www.tylerparr.com\n\nSong: Iron Pump by Olenka and the Autumn Lovers\n► http://olenkalovers.com/music_oatal.html\n► https://olenkalovers.bandcamp.com/track/iron-pump\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nConnect with Omeleto!\n\nFacebook ► http://facebook.com/omeletocom/\nTwitter ► http://twitter.com/omeletocom\nInstagram ► http://instagram.com/omeletocom/\nSnapchat ► http://snapchat.com/add/omeletocom\nNewsletter ► http://omeleto.com/join/\n\n🎬 Got a film?

Nobody has time for that and they’re like a buck or two\nTake a 13.5oz/398ml can of pure pumpkin. Not “pumpkin pie filling.” Don’t be an animal\nBut that in a bowl. It’s gonna be thick. Be prepared for that\nAdd two eggs\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \nReduce it to 350. \nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow."

zDbq7y20wpw,"Dazzle camouflage was fantastically weird. It was also surprisingly smart.\n\nWWII saw another kind of strange history unfold: a meme (yes, really). Watch our video on it here: http://bit.ly/2Co9DEu\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nDazzle camouflage was a surprisingly effective defense against torpedoes. In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explains why.\n\n\nWorld War I ships faced a unique problem. The u-boat was a new threat at the time, and its torpedoes were deadly. That led artist Norman Wilkinson to come up with dazzle camouflage (sometimes called “razzle dazzle camouflage”). The idea was to confuse u-boats about a ship’s course, rather than try to conceal its presence. In doing so, dazzle camouflage could keep torpedoes from hitting the boat — and that and other strategies proved a boon in World War I.\n\n\nThis camouflage is unusual, but its striking appearance influenced the culture, inspired cubist painters’ riffs, and even entered into the world of fashion. Though dazzle camouflage lost its utility once radar and other detection techniques took over from u-boat periscopes, for a brief period in time it was an effective and unusual way to help ships stay safe.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

However, it was that Wednesday in January seven years ago that Pioneer – the last remaining company to make the devices – declared they were ceasing production after making a final run of 3,000 LaserDisc players, bringing the total made to just under 17 million units. “Under the market environment in which new media such as DVD and Blu-ray Discs now dominate, it has become difficult for Pioneer to procure the parts required to produce LD players,” read Pioneer’s press release. “Consequently Pioneer has been forced to terminate production of its LD products.”\n\nWant the text version?: http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2016/08/why-laserdisc-lost/\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2013/10/27/5035596/lost-return-of-the-jedi-footage-discovered-on-699-laserdisc\nhttp://mentalfloss.com/article/49111/mr-wizard-explains-laserdisc\nhttp://www.cedmagic.com/history/discovision-marketed.html\nhttp://www.computerhistory.org/storageengine/optical-laser-disc-player-is-demonstrated/\nhttp://money.cnn.com/gallery/technology/innovationnation/2015/01/02/ces-gadget-hits-and-flops/2.html\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=OaEmmEOZ1fwC&pg=PA130-IA3&lpg=PA130-IA3&dq=why+laserdisc+failed&source=bl&ots=ICyBvWX99v&sig=5M2kv8tUM-tkydeGVO-i0Ioy18Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjvx7TUgOrOAhVKRSYKHTIkBc04ChDoAQgyMAM#v=onepage&q=%20laserdisc&f=false\nhttp://www.homemediamagazine.com/news/laserdisc-officially-dead-14333\nhttp://www.cnet.com/news/remember-when-video-discs-were-the-size-of-lps\nhttps://www.google.com/patents/US3350503?dq=3350503&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj12YmEjOrOAhVJfiYKHScoBMcQ6AEIHDAA\nhttp://www.blamld.com/DiscoVision/LaserMagic1998.htm\nhttp://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/magnetic4.html\nhttp://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/john-t-mullin-man-who-put-bing-crosby-tape/373927\nhttp://inventors.about.com/od/ofamousinventions/a/Optical_Disk.htm\nhttp://www.wired.com/2011/06/0607betamax-vcr-television-recorder\nhttp://gizmodo.com/5316154/magnavox-magnavision-model-8000-discovision-laserdisc-player-reviewed\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LDDVDComparison-mod.png\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserDisc\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Paul_Gregg\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Russell_(inventor)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_bias\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape_format_war\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiscoVision\n\nImage Credit:\n\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-130064534/stock-photo-compact-discs-full-of-music-laser-compact-disc-sound-technology\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-176455267/stock-photo-personal-cd-player-with-remote-control-and-portable-audio-earphones-on-black-background\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-140485571/stock-photo-remote-control-and-blu-ray-or-dvd-player-with-inserted-disc\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-126567410/stock-photo-video-tapes-audio-tapes-and-compact-disc-on-a-wooden-table\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-161982692/stock-photo-finger-pressing-a-microphone-button-to-activate-an-on-air-sign-composite-between-an-image-and-a-3d-background\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-164913281/stock-photo-3d-illustration-of-at-home-shaped-target-over-black-background-and-one-arrow-in-the-center-with-a-sign-where-it-is-written-the-word-sold-concept-of-real-estate\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-213935233/stock-photo-3d-illustration-of-rubber-stamp-with-the-text-patented-ip-law-and-intellectual-property-patent-concept\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-181439842/stock-photo-hand-writing-expensive-with-marker\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-126561608/stock-photo-closeup-of-a-stack-compact-discs-%28cd-dvd%29\nhttps://www.bigstockphoto.com/ru/image-138250820/stock-photo-map-with-pin-point-of-atlanta-in-georgia%2C-usa\n\nMusic from Jukedeck - create your own at http://jukedeck.com."

Not everything wows like gravitational waves or spacefaring sportscars. That’s the case with the recent discovery of earliest stars in the universe. In a Nature paper published a few weeks ago, Judd Bowman and collaborators report a signal from the very first stars to form in our universe. The same result also hints at brand new physics that may help explain the nature of dark matter. This result flew under the radar in part because it’s a subtle and clever result that requires a bit of interpretation. Today we’re doing a Space Time Journal Club to explain this discovery. We’ll follow that with the solution to our recent trebuchet challenge question.\n\nWritten and Hosted by Matt O'Dowd\nProduced by Rusty Ward\nGraphics by Grayson Blackmon\nAssistant Editing and Sound Design by Mike Petrow and Linda Huang\nMade by Kornhaber Brown (www.kornhaberbrown.com)\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Big Bang, Quasar and Hypernova Supporters: \n\nBig Bang\nCoolAsCats\nDavid Nicklas\nFaisal Saud\nAnton Lifshits\nJoey Redner\n\nQuasar\nTambe Barsbay\nMayank M.

The minor difference is due to different methods to analyze global temperatures used by the two agencies, although over the long-term the records remain in strong agreement.

fEskVQgtwaI,"MIDNIGHT SUN is a romantic tearjerker about 17-year-old Katie Price (Bella Thorne), sheltered at home since childhood with a rare genetic condition, a life-threatening sensitivity to sunlight.  Having only her father Jack (Rob Riggle) for company, Katie's world opens up after dark when she ventures outside to play her guitar.  One night, her dreams come true when she’s noticed and asked out by her longtime crush Charlie (Patrick Schwarzenegger), whom she’s secretly watched from her bedroom window for years.  As they embark on nightly summer excursions, Katie’s risk to sunlight grows and she’s presented with the gut-wrenching dilemma of whether she can live a normal life with her newfound soul mate."
fmqcXfcrAis,A few years ago I discovered an interesting insect behaviour whereby I could seemingly control large swarms of tiny flies/gnats simply by singing a range of tones to them. I first noticed this in the UK in 2004 but have since been able to replicate the experiment several times here in Australia and more recently captured it on video near the town of Woolgoolga in NSW.\n\nInitially I noticed that a swarm of gnats above me seemed to slow their frantic movement when I started to speak and after a little experimentation I discovered that certain higher pitched vocals would cause the flies to noticeably rise upwards as a group and then rapidly drop downwards again upon ceasing the tone.\n\nI've noticed this both with gnats in a forest environment and also with sand fly swarms at the beach. What's also interesting is the flies seem to have excellent hearing over quite some distance as I have seen them reacting to a dog barking perhaps 50m away.\n\nI'd be interested to know if anyone has ever noticed this insect behaviour before or been able to capture it on video. If you happen to be an entomologist I'd also be interested in discussing this with you.

Facing environmental disasters and a plunging birthrate, Gilead is ruled by a twisted fundamentalism in its militarized ‘return to traditional values'. As one of the few remaining fertile women, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) is a Handmaid in the Commander’s household, one of the caste of women forced into sexual servitude as a last desperate attempt to repopulate the world. In this terrifying society, Offred must navigate between Commanders, their cruel Wives, domestic Marthas, and her fellow Handmaids – where anyone could be a spy for Gilead – all with one goal: to survive and find the daughter that was taken from her."

It's downright dumb.\nIt looks like the end of the line for me here and frankly I'm terribly glum\nThat the promising future where I get to train with Luke Skywalker won't ever come\nAnd these shackles I'm shackled in sure seem robust so I'm stuck here on my bum\nIn a base this huge I feel so tiny\nOh and why's that tall Stormtrooper shiny?\nIf I could just find a way into this tin man's head, I\nMight survive to become the second-to-last Jedi\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: What did you say?)\n\nHe responded. That's a start.\nThere's a glimmer of hope in this possibly-orphaned Jakkuvian scavenger's heart\nI can do this, I swear it, by each little line that I drew like a loneliness chart\nI can do this, I swear it, by each little meal that would always taste just like a fart\nBy the bloke I like more than I care to\nBy my sensible three-level hairdo\nI call on the Force and if somehow this works, I said I\nMight survive to become the second-to-last Jedi\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum.)\n\nI'm done for! Blast it!\nThought I had him for a sec\nBut it turns out I'm screwed which has ruined my mood and now I'm a nervous wreck\nFocus! Get past it!\nDo the trick you did back when\nWithout even trying, you found yourself spying on the mind of Kylo Ren\nYou will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.\n(Stormtrooper: I will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.)\nWhaaaat?\n(He unlocks the restraints.)\n\nTa-da! See ya, big guy!\nI cannot believe that it worked, but it worked, and I honestly do not know why\nIf I hurry away before they even know I've fled I\nwill be well on my way or at least one step closer to having a chance to become \nthe second-to-last Jediiiiii!\nAnd you'll drop your weapon. \n(he does)\nYes!\n\n** THANKS FOR WATCHING! :) **\n\nIf you made it all the way to here, comment I hope Daisy Ridley sees this below!"

Hall (TV’s “Dexter” and “Six Feet Under”) and Kyle Chandler (“Manchester by the Sea,” TV’s “Bloodline”).\n\nBateman and McAdams star as Max and Annie, whose weekly couples game night gets kicked up a notch when Max’s charismatic brother, Brooks (Chandler), arranges a murder mystery party, complete with fake thugs and faux federal agents. So when Brooks gets kidnapped, it’s all part of the game…right?  But as the six uber-competitive gamers set out to solve the case and win, they begin to discover that neither this “game”—nor Brooks—are what they seem to be.  Over the course of one chaotic night, the friends find themselves increasingly in over their heads as each twist leads to another unexpected turn.  With no rules, no points, and no idea who all the players are, this could turn out to be the most fun they’ve ever had…or game over.\n\n“Game Night” is written by Mark Perez (“Accepted”).  John Davis (“Joy”), John Fox (TV’s “The Blacklist”), Jason Bateman and Jim Garavente (“Bad Words”) are producing. Serving as executive producers are Marc S. Fischer, Richard Brener, Michael Disco and Dave Neustadter.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes team includes director of photography Barry Peterson (“Central Intelligence,” “We’re the Millers”), Oscar-nominated production designer Michael Corenblith (“How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” “Apollo 13”), editors Jamie Gross (“Vacation”), Gregory Plotkin (“Get Out”) and David Egan (“Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return”), and costume designer Debra McGuire (“Vacation,” “Ted”).\n\nThe film will be released worldwide beginning February 23, 2018.\n“Game Night” is a New Line Cinema presentation and will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment company.\n\nRated R for language, sexual references and some violence."

7cTi6PHUqMw,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Tuesday, November 21st 2017) John talks about the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nMeghan Dunn - I really liked Murder on the Orient Express and I just heard that Fox is setting up a sequel with Death on the Nile. Do you know if Kenneth Branagh is coming back?\n\nCameron - I often see people talk about Marvel, DC, Universal and the Conjuring when it comes to cinematic universes, but how come no one talks about Legendary's Monsterverse? They seem to being well critically and financially, plus there's only four confirmed movies (Godzilla 2014, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong) with two coming soon.\n\nSean Burtt - Why is everyone buzzing about this new Tarantino movie, I get that the idea of it is interesting and exciting. But the reports are that it had a $93 million budget, did no one pay attention to Hateful eight, it made no money. So why would Sony pay all this money when history doesn't really justify it.\n\nKyle - Recently, some former colleagues of yours have suggested that JL’s poor performance was due solely because of the response from critics. I find this ridiculous. If critics had that much effect on the opening weekend numbers, why did Suicide Squad open bigger? Why are critics being targeted when they are only trying to protect the consumer?\n\nMarcus Mann - Hey John love your show been watching since the Collider days. You said that several movies that have come out are being miss marketed like JL and Murder on the Orient Express. I saw a trailer for Ready Player One this weekend and have NO idea what it is about. Do you have any thoughts on their marketing of this movie so far?"

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot. As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy. Originally conceived as a concept album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the show eventually made its way to the stage in 1971 and garnered five Tony nominations in addition to winning a Drama Desk Award for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Now this globally celebrated classic comes to NBC in 2018 for a one-of-a-kind live staging on Easter Sunday that's sure to amaze with jaw-dropping spectacle, an all-star cast of beloved recording artists and a fresh soundtrack featuring such hits as Heaven on Their Minds, I Don't Know How to Love Him and Superstar.\n\nSuperstar: Brandon Victor Dixon - Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\nhttps://youtu.be/yleuZbY8rKk\n\nNBC on YouTube\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc"

This was the first Oscar win for Peele, he said, This means so much to me. I stopped writing this movie 20 times because I thought... no one would ever make this movie. This is a historic win as Peele is the first black writer to win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nIn Get Out, photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is nervous about meeting his girlfriend Rose's parents for the first time, especially when he learns that she has not told them that he is black. Their awkward behavior, along with the oddness exhibited by their two African-American servants, puts Chris on alert but even so, he is unprepared for the family's true motivations.\n\nWatch the trailer on Oscar.com here: http://oscar.go.com/video/best-actor-nominees/get-out-trailer\n\nFor more Oscars highlights and can't miss moments visit Oscar.com:\nAcceptance Speeches & Interviews: http://oscar.go.com/video \nRed Carpet Galleries: http://oscar.go.com/red-carpet\nWinners: http://oscar.go.com/winners"

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from our online shop! - https://shop.simonscat.com/"

wbxblKFtGCg,"Higher is the title song for Wildlife feature film Wild Amsterdam playing in cinemas across Holland now. More info: http://dutchnaturefilms.com. Taken from the album Don Diablo - FUTURE: http://www.tinyurl.com/DonDiabloFuture  \n\nA few years ago I had the honour of making the end credit as well as the title song for an independent film called The New Wilderness. Much to everyones surprise that film ended up becoming one of the highest grossing films in Dutch cinema history and a sequel seemed inevitable. That sequel is finally here and when they asked me to provide a title song once more I couldn't refuse. I love the passion, dedication and patience the film makers put into these films and being a longtime inhabitant of Amsterdam myself it felt extra special to be a part of this incredible project. \n\nDirected by: Mark Verkerk\nProduced by: Ignas van Schaick \nEdit: Thomas Pieket Weeserik \nAdditional Camerawork: Patrick Van Der Wal \nSFX: Erik Middendorp\nExecutive Producer: Don Diablo\n\nProduction Company: EMS Films Holland \n\n⬡⬢ Don Diablo ⬢⬡\nSpotify ⬡ http://Spoti.fi/DonDiablo\nMerch ⬡ http://shop.dondiablo.com\nInstagram ⬡ http://instagram.com/dondiablo\nFacebook ⬡ http://facebook.com/OfficialDonDiablo\nTwitter ⬡ http://twitter.com/dondiablo\nYouTube ⬡ http://YouTube.com/DonDiablo?sub_confirmation=1\nSoundCloud ⬡ http://soundcloud.com/dondiablo"

Change out the towel each time the towel gets damp to make your lettuce last longer.\nStore milk sideways so the liquid covers the inside of the lid, creating a seal to prevent bacteria.\nInsert a piece of parchment paper between each slice of bread before freezing. This will extend your bread’s life and prevent them from sticking to each other in the cold.\nFreeze unused butter until you need them to slow down the expiration date.\nPut onions in a clean pair of tights, tying a small knot between each onion.

The Falcon Heavy is a monster. \n\nIt has 27 engines, can generate more power than 18 747 jumbo jets, and is the most powerful rocket to fly since NASA's moon rocket, the Saturn V.\n\nMaking it the most powerful functioning rocket on Earth. This is one of SpaceX's most difficult launches. Musk even said Just bear in mind that there is a good chance this monster rocket blows up.\n\nBut it didn't!\n\nEven though this was a test launch, Musk took the opportunity to send some payload to space. A Tesla Roadster, which will eventually reach Mars' orbit.\n\nNow, that's a rocket test like we've never seen before. Afterward, SpaceX retrieved each of the 3 boosters for possible reuse. They landed one booster on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean and 2 at its landing base in Florida.\n\nMusk has said the Falcon Heavy could usher people to Mars someday in the future. That day now looks closer than ever. And who knows?\n\nMaybe a Roadster will be waiting when they get there.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

IgUlowmSeHo,"It's a humbling situation, but much about who we are as adults can be traced back to things that happened to us before our 12th birthday. Part of learning to be an adulthood means making sense of the events of our childhood. We need to spot how our past might be trying to interfere with our chances in the present.

Our childhoods, even the apparently benign ones, leave us no option but to be anything else.\nAs a result of these childhoods, we tend, over most issues, to list – like a sailing yacht in high wind – far too much in one direction or another. We are too timid, or too assertive; too rigid or too accommodating; too focused on material success or excessively lackadaisical. We are obsessively eager around sex or painfully wary and nervous in the face of our own erotic impulses. We are dreamily naive or sourly down to earth; we recoil from risk or embrace it recklessly; we have emerged into adult life determined never to rely on anyone or as desperate for another to complete us; we are overly intellectual or unduly resistant to ideas. The encyclopedia of emotional imbalances is a volume without end. What is certain is that these imbalances come at a huge cost, rendering us less able to exploit our talents and opportunities, less able to lead satisfying lives and a great deal less fun to be around…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here: https://goo.gl/6ubziU\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nVisit us in person at our London HQ: https://goo.gl/qf1h3j\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nYou can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&tab=2 \nFind out how more here: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB \n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nDownload our App: https://goo.gl/b7FNXL\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nDirected by: Hannah & Martha \n\nDesign: Hannah McNally\n\nAnimation Team: Flora Caulton, Emily Downe, Martha Halliday, Hannah McNally, Kathrin Steinbacher \n\nwww.hannahandmartha.com\n\nwww.floracaulton.co.uk\n\nwww.emilydowne.co.uk\n\nwww.kathrinsteinbacher.com"

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official webshop - https://simonscat.theofficialwebshop.com/"

Quality time with kids also helps them in school. But just as important are avoiding mistakes that can curtail a child's social, physical, emotional and intellectual development. The following is a transcript of this video.\n\nParents of unsuccessful kids could have these 6 things in common.\n\nThey're authoritarian. Authoritarian parents discourage open communication. They make demands without explaining why. One study showed, when these parents checked children's homework it inhibited the child's overall school performance.\n\nParents who let kids watch TV when they're really young. Researchers said children who watched more TV were less likely to participate in class and had lower math scores. \n\nParents who yell at their kids a lot. Shouting, cursing and insults can have the same negative effects as physical discipline.\n\nThey're helicopter parents. Over-controlling parents have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression in children. Researchers found these children were less open to new ideas and more self-conscious.\n\nParents who are emotionally distant. This can contribute to: behavioral problems, insecurity, and emotional difficulties.\n\nParents who spank their kids. First graders who already had behavioral problems were even more disruptive if their parents spanked them. Spanking has also been linked to mental health problems and cognitive difficulties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

In Theaters March 9.\n\nWatch the greenband trailer now: http://bit.ly/GringoOfficialTrailer\n\nAn exhilarating mix of dark comedy, white-knuckle action and dramatic intrigue, Gringo joyrides into Mexico, where mild-mannered businessman Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) finds himself at the mercy of his back-stabbing business colleagues back home, local drug lords and a morally conflicted black-ops mercenary. Crossing the line from law-abiding citizen to wanted criminal, Harold battles to survive his increasingly dangerous situation in ways that raise the question: Is he out of his depth — or two steps ahead?\n\n#GringoMovie\n\n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AmazonVideoSubscribe\n» In Theaters March 9\n\nAbout Gringo:\nMild-mannered pharmaceutical company executive Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) takes a business trip from Chicago to Mexico with his cutthroat bosses Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine (Charlize Theron). At the company’s Mexican lab, Richard orders manager Sanchez (Hernán Mendoza) to stop selling the bioengineered marijuana product Cannabax to a brutal, Beatles-loving cartel kingpin known as The Black Panther. Meanwhile, straight-arrow Harold learns he’ll be out of a job as soon as Richard and Elaine sell their newly cleaned-up company to a conglomerate. And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that she’s having an affair.\n\nTargeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them he’s been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Harold’s prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.\n\nPursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.\nDirected by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J.

X_tYrnv_o6A,"These are the molecular machines inside your body that make cell division possible. Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno"

About reuniting with boyfriend Matthew Koma, she shares, It's going so great. I mean, this is like the third time that we've dated and I think that what [Gomez] says has so much merit to it. Timing is such a big deal... third time's a charm! I think that you have history and a past with someone and love, and just because it doesn't work out the first time, the second time, as long as there's not too much damage done, then, it can always work out again.\n\nSubscribe To The Talk Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/10hBiIw\nWatch Full Episodes of The Talk HERE: http://bit.ly/Wz3H0U\nFollow “The Talk” on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1OLLdk1\nLike The Talk on Facebook HERE: http://on.fb.me/12v9WlC\nFollow “The Talk” on Instagram HERE: http://bit.ly/1hggnWc\nFollow The Talk on Google+ HERE: http://bit.ly/1SOobzn\n\nGet the CBS app for iPhone & iPad!

At Shuko, one of the premiere sushi restaurants in NYC, the menu is driven by the imaginations of Nick Kim and Jimmy Lau, as well as the whims of Mother Nature. Hyper-fresh cuts of bluefin tuna, squid, barracuda, and needlefish travel from the chefs' hands directly to the diners' plates. The result is a meal that flows seamlessly from one course to the next. One of Manhattan's most traditional omakase experiences, as well as one of its most boundary-pushing, Shuko is a bucket-list destination for sushi obsessives worldwide. \n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect."

The trade details a long list of reasons that include clashes between him and his Freddie Mercury actor Rami Malek, absences from the set that would force cinematographer Thomas Newton Sigel to step in and direct; and actor Tom Hollander, who plays Queen manager Jim Beach, is said to have briefly quit the film because of the director’s behavior, but was persuaded to return. \n\nWith Star Wars The Last Jedi ready to debut in theatres next Friday, director Rian Johnson is now making the press rounds on the promotional tour. Not surprising, The Last Jedi talk soon turned to his new trilogy of films separate from the Saga, which is said to be a whole new story with characters we’ve yet to meet. Collider’s own Steve Weintraub spoke to Johnson about the new trilogy and asked if he’d like to direct all three movies.\n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nSpeaking at the recent Heroes & Villains convention in San Jose, CA - Shazam himself, Zachary Levi, talked a bit about the upcoming adaptation, revealing that he thinks the movie could surprise audiences in the same way Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy did.\n\nIn a report from Deadline, James Franco is in talks to direct and star in a film about children’s book author Shel Silverstein. Writers Chris Shafer and Paul Vicknair will pen the adaptation based on Lisa Rogak’s book “A Boy Named Shel.” Silverstein, a poet, singer, songwriter, and screenwriter, has seen his work translated into more than 30 languages, selling over 20 million copies in total. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Rocha: https://twitter.com/TheRochaSays\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

The Movie grossed more than $600 million around the world, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi in an all-new original musical based on the songs of ABBA.  With the film’s original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open on July 20, 2018.\n\nMamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film.  Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical.  \n\nOl Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker.  Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers.  Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis and Nicky Kentish Barnes also serve as executive producers.\n\nReprising their roles from Mamma Mia! The Movie are Academy Award® winner Meryl Streep as Donna, Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Oscar® winner Colin Firth return to play Sophie’s three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.\n\nAs the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna.

Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends)."

Nz0qoOgyWSQ,"Paper Magazine debuted a racy cover featuring Nicki Minaj. Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her. Go women in hip hop. It's not my thing.

We’ve talked about collaborating since then. \n\nDon: When I met Ansel I knew he was a very talented actor but when I first heard him sing he totally blew my mind.\n\nAnsel: ‘Believe’ started as an instrumental that Don sent me in late 2015 I always loved it but wasn’t sure what to write to it that would be as epic as Don’s production.  \n\nDon: It took a while for us to finish the record but we wanted it to be something we both truly loved. \n\nAnsel: I was inspired by Freddie Mercury’s epic song writing, something that could be an arena anthem but also holds deeper meaning.”\n\nDon: After Ansel's vocals were recorded I got so inspired I ended up lifting the instrumental itself as well and I feel we both delivered a song that we can be proud of for the years to come. \n\nLyrics:\nPromises promises, year after year on my knees\nParadise knocks for my future, just have to believe\nFlood flood flood in the streets so they said\nBlood blood blood in the streets of my head\n\nDo you believe in me\nDo you believe in me\nWe believed in you\nWe believed in you\n\nJust listen to Father and he’ll set you up to seek seeds \nIn the soil to dry to produce what we \nNeed for our family trees\nCutting down to our knees\nWe look up to the sky to retell the old \nStories of glorious, battles victorious\nBrothers notorious, empires turn to dust\nMen turned delirious, reasons mysterious\nDestruction comes near to us, our mothers shed tears for us\n\nDo you believe in me\nDo you believe in me\nWe believed in you\nWe believed in you\n\nLived on my knees\nThey told me that you’d set me free\nWe lost our years together because of the fear\nKnow i’m never gonna make it there\nI just wanted Eden on repeated sunny days\nThe land below me cracks and tears\nLook into the sky through the thick and rainy haze\n\nDo you believe in me\nDo you believe in me\nWe believed in you\nWe believed in you\n\nAnimation: Erik Middendorp for HEXAGON FILM\nExecutive Producer: Don Diablo \n\n⬡⬢ Don Diablo ⬢⬡\nSpotify ⬡ http://Spoti.fi/DonDiablo\nMerch ⬡ http://shop.dondiablo.com\nInstagram ⬡ http://instagram.com/dondiablo\nFacebook ⬡ http://facebook.com/OfficialDonDiablo\nTwitter ⬡ http://twitter.com/dondiablo\nYouTube ⬡ http://YouTube.com/DonDiablo?sub_confirmation=1\nSoundCloud ⬡ http://soundcloud.com/dondiablo"

Business began to take off once Jesse Owens won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics while wearing Dassler sneakers. But with great success brought great competition. Soon, sibling rivalry split the brothers and their company apart, with each creating their own line of shoes. Today, Adidas and Puma continue to be leaders within the shoe industry, while brothers Adolf and Rudolph lie buried at opposite ends of a soccer field as their feud continues on into eternity.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/vR6Acb\n\nThis story is a part of our Human Condition series.
